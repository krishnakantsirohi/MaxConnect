Let say the max player for game state is 1.
Initial score for both the player is 0.

The scores for quadruple have been defined as follows:
1100 & 2200: +2
1110 & 2220: +3
1111 & 2222: +4

Function getScore(int player) searches for either 1111 or 2222 depending upon the player currently playing and assigns a score of 4 to the player.
Function get3Score(int player) searches for either 1110 or 2220 depending upon the player currently playing and assigns a score of 3 to the player.
Function get2Score(int player) searches for either 1100 or 2200 depending upon the player currently playing and assigns a score of 2 to the player.

Then the utility function returns the following: 
Score of player 2 - score of player 1
